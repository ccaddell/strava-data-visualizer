# Strava Data Visualizer

A web appliation for visualizing personal fitness activity data pulled from the Strava API.
## Features (Planned and in Progress)


- Interactive graphs for viewing activity metrics over any period of time
- Filtering by activity type
- Using a weather API to see the temperature and other weather data during activities
- Database to store data locally for improved performance and to limit Strava API calls


## Motivation

Iâ€™m building this project to mix my love of running with my interest in data visualization. I want to create features that help me analyze my training data in more meaningful ways such as comparing different workouts or tracking changes in things like pace and distance over time. Ultimately, I hope this web app helps me get more out of my training while also giving me a chance to sharpen my skills with APIs and databases.
